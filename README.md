# Terminus AI Coding Assistant

Terminus is an intelligent AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers with various coding tasks through natural language interaction. It uses OpenAI's GPT models to understand user queries and execute appropriate actions using a structured thinking process.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **AI-Powered Assistance**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models for intelligent code assistance
- ðŸ”§ **Command Execution**: Can execute shell commands to help with development tasks
- ðŸ§  **Structured Thinking**: Uses a START â†’ THINK â†’ OBSERVE â†’ OUTPUT approach for problem-solving
- ðŸ’¬ **Interactive Interface**: Clean command-line interface with colored output
- ðŸŽ¯ **Coding Focus**: Specifically designed for coding-related queries and tasks

```

### Example Interaction
```
ðŸ¤–: Hello! I am Terminus, your AI coding assistant. How can I help you today?
ðŸ‘¤: Create a simple HTML page with a contact form
ðŸ§ : The user wants to create an HTML page with a contact form...
ðŸ”§: Tool called executeCommand with input mkdir contact-form
ðŸ’¬: I've created a contact form HTML page with proper styling and structure.
```

## Available Tools

- **executeCommand**: Executes shell commands and returns output
- More tools can be easily added to the `src/tools/` directory

## How It Works

Terminus follows a structured approach to problem-solving:

1. **START**: User provides a query
2. **THINK**: AI analyzes the query and plans the solution
3. **ACTION**: If needed, executes appropriate tools
4. **OBSERVE**: Reviews the results of actions
5. **OUTPUT**: Provides the final response

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)

### Model Configuration
The default model is `gpt-4.1`, but this can be changed in `src/config/openai.js`.

## Development

### Adding New Tools
1. Create your tool function in `src/tools/index.js`
2. Add it to the `TOOLS_MAP` in `src/core/terminus.js`
3. Update the system prompt in `src/config/prompts.js` to include the new tool

### Project Guidelines
- Follow ES6 module syntax
- Use descriptive function names and comments
- Keep tools focused and single-purpose
- Handle errors gracefully
